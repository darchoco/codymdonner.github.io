<p>How do you prove that you exist...? Maybe we don't exist...</p> 

<p>I always talked about you, Zidane. 
  How you were a very special person to us, because you taught us all how important life is. 
  You taught me that life doesn't last forever. 
  That's why we have to help each other and live life to the fullest. 
  Even if you say goodbye, you'll always be in our hearts. 
  So, I know we're not alone anymore. 
   I was born... How I wanted to live... Thanks for giving me time to think. 
   To keep doing what you set your heart on... It's a very hard thing to do. 
   We were all so courageous... What to do when I felt lonely... That was the only thing you couldn't teach me. 
   But we need to figure out the answer for ourselves... I'm so happy I met everyone... I wish we could've gone on more adventures. 
   But I guess we all have to say goodbye someday. Everyone... Thank you. Farewell. 
  My memories will be part of the sky...</p>
